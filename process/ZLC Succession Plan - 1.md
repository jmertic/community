# Overview
The orginal Zowe founders each nominated 2 members to make up the Zowe Leadership Committee (from Broadcom, IBM and Rocket Software). This committee is, and has been, responsible for steering the Zowe organization and setting a vision that aligns all the Zowe squads and sub projects.  One of the original goals of the Project is to promote a diverse community made up of a Leadership Committee elected by the Zowe Community.

Unlike most other Open Source communities the Zowe Project needs to blend 50 years of IBM Z Software, processes and culture with open source velocity and innovation.  One such challenge is the issue of support and expectations by consumers for delivery of Zowe in a way that ensures a level playing field for all contributors as well as delivering Zowe software in a way that is supportable and stable.  As indicated, this is a challenging process.

In order to encourage new participation in the ZLC and to secure a transfer of vision without disruption to the community the ZLC proposes the following approach.   


## Year 1 (August 14, 2018 - August 4, 2019)
The orginial 6 ZLC members will maintain their position in the organization for a 3-year term (to be up for re-election in Aug, 2022).  A resignation by an original member will be filled with a representative from the original founding organization.

## Year 2 (August 2019 - 2020)
2 new ZLC seats will be made available (total of 8 ZLC members)

Those 2 new seats will be elected on the normal voting and nomination process as described in the governance.md

Those 2 new seats will have a 3-year term (to be up for re-election in 2022)

## Year 3 (August 2020 - 2021)
2 new ZLC seats will be made available (total of 10 ZLC members)

Those 2 new seats will be elected on the normal voting and nomination process as described in the governance.md

Those 2 new seats will have a 3-year term (to be up for re-election in 2023)

## Year 4 (August 2021 - 2022)
2 new ZLC seats will be made available (total of 12 ZLC members)

Those 2 new seats will be elected on the normal voting and nomination process as described in the governance.md

Those 2 new seats will have a 3-year term (to be up for re-election in 2024)

## Year 5 (August 2022 - 2023)
This year the founding member ZLC will be disolved (ZLC members elected in '19 - -20 have served their 3 year term) and a total of 8 seats will become available (plus any new nomination will be considered) and will be up for re-election to fill 2 seats. Each active committer will be allowed to cast 2 votes for the nominees and the top 2 recieving the most votes will sit for another 3-year term. The ZLC will now be capped at a total of 6 members at any one time.

## Year  (August 2023 - 2024)
This year the ZLC members elected in '20 - '21 have served their 3 year term and their seats are now up for re-election. Each active committer will be able to cast 2 votes and the 2 recipients with the most votes will fill those seats.

## Year 7 (August 2024 - 2025)
This year the ZLC members elected in '21 - '22 have served their 3 year term and their seats are now up for re-election. Each active committer will be able to cast 2 votes and the 2 recipients with the most votes will fill those seats.
