# Zowe Sub-Project Proposal Process

This documnt is based on the [CNCF Project Proposal Process v1.1](https://github.com/CNCF/toc/blob/40abe6f81c2b46842a87d6c47cf4190f0d8c1856/process/project_proposals.adoc).

## Introduction

This governance policy sets forth the proposal process for sub-projects to be accepted into Zowe. The process is the same for both existing projects which seek to move into Zowe, and new projects to be formed within Zowe. Zowe Leadership Committee (ZLC) will review all proposals in a timely manner.

## Sub-Project Proposal Requirements

Projects must be proposed via a Zowe Leadership Committee (ZLC) issue to [https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues](GitHub) with the "enhancement" label. Project proposals submitted to the ZLC must provide the following information to the best of your ability:

* Name of project (must be unique within Zowe)
* Project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history)
* Statement on alignment with Zowe mission
* Sponsor from ZLC (sponsor helps mentor projects)
* License and contribution guidelines (Zowe project requires code contributions to Zowe are to be made under the [Eclipse Public License 2.0 (EPL-2.0)](https://spdx.org/licenses/EPL-2.0.html) and all non-code contributions are to be made under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC-BY-4.0)](https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0.html) unless otherwise approved by the Open Mainframe Project Governing Board, having each committer agree to the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/)
* Review the [Zowe License and Copyright Guidence](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/blob/master/process/LicenseAndCopyrightGuidance.md)
* Source control (GitHub by default)
* External dependencies (including licenses)
* Initial committers (how long working on project)
* Infrastructure requests (CI / OMP Cluster)
* Communication channels (Slack, irc, mailing lists)
* Issue tracker (GitHub by default)
* Prefered maturity level (see Zowe Graduation Criteria below)

## Project Acceptance Process

* Projects are required to schedule and present their proposal at a ZLC meeting. You can check the meeting schedules in the [Zowe Development Calendar].(https://lists.openmainframeproject.org/g/zowe-dev/calendar)
* Projects get accepted via a 2/3 supermajority vote of the ZLC.
* All projects must adopt the OMP [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md).
* All projects agree to transfer any relevant trademarks to ZLC and to assist in filing for any relevant unregistered ones. This assignment will be reversed if the project does not remain in the ZLC, as described below. Note that no patent or copyright assignment is necessary because the [Eclipse Public License 2.0 (EPL-2.0)](https://spdx.org/licenses/EPL-2.0.html) provides sufficient protections for other developers and users.
* All projects start at the [Incubation stage](stages.md) by default unless the ZLC approves otherwise.
