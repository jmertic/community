# What is Zowe?

Zowe is an integrated and extensible open source software for z/OS with a coherent and curated set of user and programmatic interfaces that:

- Provide consistent access to z/OS systems and services
- Leverage industry standard methodologies and standards familiar to the vast majority of todayâ€™s developers
- Are commonly accepted as a standard within the mainframe community

The Zowe binary downloads come with a set of applications built on top of the framework that, together deliver a cloud-like integration experience that are intended to unify an organization's IT infrastructure and application delivery.

# What Zowe isn't?

While Zowe is a vast project, there are some key things that are considered out of scope.

- Zowe is not meant for any other platform other than z/OS ( though being open source, one could always fork to support a different OS )
- Zowe is not meant to be the entire breadth of open source on z/OS, nor synomonous with it.
- Zowe is not meant to be a full solution; it's intended to make downstream solutions better and easier to maintain and develop.
- Zowe is not a cloud platform, but can be used in the stack for a cloud platform.

# Zowe success metrics

The Zowe ZLC establishes measureable objectives for what it sees as success. The metrics are developed using the [SMART criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria). Metrics are set for an entire calendar year (i.e. to be achieved by 12/31 of the given year).

Being an open source project, the targets set tend to be asperational and are more used as a tool to focus activities and identify gaps.
