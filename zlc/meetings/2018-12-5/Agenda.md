### Discuss
Update: Discussed during the meeting and made some revisions.  Members to review and start vote this week.

Rocket is planning on completing the open sourcing of the required function for ZSS in time for the 2019-01-22 release of Zowe.  Work will continue and communication in the Slack channels.

Hogstrom will work on a build environment on river.zowe.org until the OMP has alternative infrastructure in place.  We will use a ZDT instance to compile the ZSS code.  [Sean](@1000torquisepogs) will create a  repository for ZSS with a "Hello world" app that we can use to build up the infrastructure.

As a result of Rocket's feedback the ZLC voted to target the Zowe 1.0 release for 2019-01-22.
January 22 is the target date for Zowe 1.0
