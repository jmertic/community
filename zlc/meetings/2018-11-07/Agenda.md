[EPL-2.0 Component for ZSS enhancement to do](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/issues/26)  
This is the current proposal for ZSS, still under discussion.  
  For ZSS, Rocket will host ZSS on their website with Rocket terms and conditions  
  Zowe would not ship the ZSS component and would need to go to Rocket  
  There are no redistribution rights for downstream consumers
