## Zowe Sub-projects

The Zowe community consists of several sub-projects that focus on specific areas of the codebase. Like any open source project, each sub-projects has it's own governance structure and release process that aligns with the primary framework guidelines.

Current Zowe Sub-projects are:

### Zowe API Mediation layer

Gateway that acts as a reverse proxy for z/OS services, together with a catalog of REST APIs and a dynamic discovery capability. This project includes provides core services for working with MVS Data Sets, JES, as well as working with z/OSMF REST APIs and a framework for Single Sign On (SSO).

### Zowe CLI

Command-line interface that lets you interact with the mainframe remotely and use common tools such as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), shell commands, bash scripts, and build tools for mainframe development. It provides a set of utilities and services for application developers that want to become efficient in supporting and building z/OS applications quickly. The CLI provides a core set of commands for working with data sets, USS, JES, as well as issuing TSO and console commands.

* The code must compile/transpile (where applicable) and pass a smoke test such that the code is not known to break the current state of Zowe.
* The pull request must describe the purpose and implementation to the extent that the maintainer understands what is being accomplished. Some pull requests need less details than others depending on novelty.
* The pull request must state how to test this change, if applicable, such that the maintainer or a QA team can check correctness. The explanation may simply be to run included test code.
* If a pull request depends upon a pull request from the same / another repository that is pending, this must be stated such that maintainers know in which order to merge open pull requests.

### Reporting Security Issues
