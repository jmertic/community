# Zowe Squad guidelines

Squads are autonomious groups that manages the development of portions of the Zowe project. Being autonomious means that the role of the Zowe Techincal Steering Committee (TSC) isn't to interfere or dictate how a squad is to run. That all said, Zowe is a community that is both open, transparent, and welcoming, and wants to ensure all the squads also are built within this spirit.

This document is meant to outline both "the guard rails" as well as the best practices for being a Zowe squad.

## Things that every Squad should do

- Complete the [new squad checklist](new-squad-checklist.md) and post it where you keep process and meeting docs for the project. The checklist will help the squad onboard into Zowe and move along towards Graduation with ease.
- Have a place which holds all the squad's process and governance documents. Generally this should be referred to in the README.md file in each repo a squad manages. Key docs to point to in the README.md file include...
  - GOVERNANCE.md, which defines squad roles and how descsions are made. A great starting point is at [example_governance.md](example_governance.md), which can then be tailored to your squad's needs
  - COMMITTERS file ( preferably in a CSV or YAML format that is machine readable ), which identifies who in the project is a committer.
  - CONTRIBUTING.md file, which describes how to contribute code and report issues in that repository.
  - All past meeting notes ( and recordings if applicable )
- Add your regular squad meeting to the Zowe Development calendar. Each squad's lead should have access to do this, let the TSC know if you don't.
  - If you need a web conference meeting for your squad, let the TSC know and they can provision one.

## Best practices for having a successful squad

The TSC wants to ensure that all squads can have smooth operations and broad awareness so that they can focus on developing innovative technology. Here's a few best practices to make that easier...

- Make it easy for the community to participate in squad meetings.
  - Advertise your squad meetings and agendas ahead of time via Slack and the mailing lists.
  - Consider using Github Issues for tracking agenda items. Open Mainframe Project TAC leverages a Github Actions integration that pulls all open Github Issues tagged 'meeting-agenda' to produce an agenda that is automatically distributed - let us know if you'd like to use something similar.
  - Share meeting notes via Slack and mailing lists as well, along with recordings, which helps people who can't attend keep abreast of the discussion.
- Share highlights and milestones with the community. Zowe had a Medium Blog and Open Mainframe Project maintains a blog if you'd like to guest post there. If you are posting somewhere else, be sure to let the [Open Mainframe Project social team] know so we can promote it through the project channels as well.
- Rotate meeting note taking - sometimes note takers find it hard to participate in the discussion and take notes, so rotating ensures that everyone has a chance to participate.
- Work to resolve any issues in an amicable way and with consensus from the group. Open source projects work best when all participants feel heard; take the extra time to listen and take all feedback into consideration.
