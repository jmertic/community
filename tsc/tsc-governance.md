# Zowe Techincal Steering Committee Governance

This document outlines the governance for the Zowe Techincal Steering Committee (TSC).

Zowe aims to be governed in a transparent, accessible way for the benefit of the community. All participation in Zowe is open and not bound to corporate affilation. Participants are bound to the [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Role and responsibilities

The TSC has the role of:

- Drive consensus on the technical direction for Zowe.
- Forum for cross squad collaboration and integration, with the aim of reducing reducancies and identifying synergy opportunities.
- Gain collective understanding of the current technologies in Zowe.
- Establish and oversee the lifecycle for techincal squads.

## Anti-purposes

While the TSC serves as the focal point in the Zowe project, there are some areas that are out of scope for the TSC.

- The TSC does not dictate on how a squad is to be governed, only that it aligns with the governance principles for squads.
- The TSC does not provide legal guidance or advise to squads; legal questions should be directed to [LF Legal] and [Open Mainframe Project Program Manager].
- The TSC does not engage in downstream products and projects from the Zowe project.

## Composition

The TSC voting members are composed of leaders within the Zowe community as follows.

- 1 representative from each squad in an Active stage.
- n Integrations Architects elected from the community.

Integration Architects are Active Zowe Committers that are elected annually by Active Zowe Committers.

### Chairperson

The TSC will elect a chairperson to help lead the TSC meetings and day-to-day activities of the TSC.

The role of the chairperson includes...

- Prepare for and lead meetings of the TSC
- Drive consensus within the TSC
- Be the primary spokesperson for the Zowe project publically ( with the option to delegate that as it makes sense )

The TSC will leverage the [Open Mainframe Project community election guidelines] for electing a chairperson, and determine the term for a the chairperson.

### Secretary

The TSC may chose to elect a secretary, or have a rotating secretarial duty amongst TSC voting members.

The role of the secretary includes...

- Ensure the agenda for the TSC meeting is prepared and shared with the Zowe community.
- Take notes during the TSC meeting, and share them after the meeting along with any meeting recording.
- Ensure any action items during the meeting are captured and assigned accordingly.

## Meetings

All meetings of the TSC are open to the community at large and posted on the [Zowe Community Calendar]. Agenda items can be proposed for the next TSC meeting by creating a GitHub Issue tagged ```meeting-agenda```, no later than the day before the meeting. Meeting Agendas will be shared via the [Zowe Dev mailing list] and posted in the [#zowe-dev channel on OMP Slack](https://slack.openmainframeproject.org)

## Changing TSC Governance

The initial TSC Governance was established by the Zowe ZLC. Any updates or changes to this governance can be made by the TSC with a supermajority of voting members voting in the affirmative ( supermajority is 2/3rds of voting members ).
