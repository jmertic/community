Outcomes
--------

1. Tim
	- Develop and propose a comprehensive versioning strategy
		- How to coincide with LTSR? Tie to Zowe component versions?
	- Work closely with the OMP (John Mertic) to design and implement the App Directory
	- Develop testing roadmap (evaluation guide)
	- Improve the consumibility of Zowe conformant applications
		- NPM tagging, etc.

2. Bruce
	- Spin up a cross squad team to decide on item is my deck slide 
		- Research how other open source communities address “support” including LTSR fix criterial 
		- Obtain input from each squad on what they think MVP is for LTSR and when it is achievable  
		- Survey Zowe consumers/exploiters on their requirements for LTSR 
		- Is LTSR necessary in next 1-2 years? 
		- Document – as best we can – the requirements for a build environment for LTSR
		- Draft a support policy for review and comment by the community 
		- Document how LTSR and vNext interrelate 
	- Link with conformance for 2020
	
3. Mark
	- Align LTSR timeline, "vNext" (2.0) roadmap items, Conformance 2020, and any other supporting work like CI/CD.
		- I think the working group Bruce proposed is a good place to start laying groundwork and keep these activities in sync
		- The working group should have participant crossover with the weekly architecture meetings.
