Please follow this process for submitting a video, tutorial, demo to the OMP Youtube channel. Once a video is posted on the OMP Youtube channel you may reference it in additional Zowe materials, communications and online content.

1. **Record your content**

- Think about your target audience. Your recording should have a clear purpose, a quick pace and show only what is necessary. When the purpose of your recording is to educate your audience, try to aim for the sweet spot of a total recording time between 5-7min. If your video is aimed to highlight features and value propositions, aim for a total recording time of 2-3min.
- Prepare for your recording. When a video is recorded, there is a higher expectation from the viewer that the delivery be without fault. A script can help ensure that.
- Test your recording equipment and make sure you have good audio prior to starting your recording.

2. **Add Intro and Exit Slides**

- Once your content is recorded please add the following OMP Standard slide to the intro and end of your recording.
